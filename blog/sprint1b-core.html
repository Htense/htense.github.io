          <div class="writting">
            <p> I tried a questionnaire online and got the following values - close, but not quite right for me:
            </p>
            <p><strong>SELF-BELIEVER</strong><br>
            Your objective is to bring confidence. While you might not know what the future is going to bring, it does not disturb you. Somewhere deep in your mind and heart, you know - no matter what happens, you will go through it.
            </p>
            <p><strong>TIME KEEPER</strong><br>
            Your objective is to set timelines and deadlines. Because of your dislike of surprises, you love to plan. You don't necessarily need to control everything and everyone, but there must be order and predictability in the world around you.
            </p>
            <p><strong>EMPATHIZER</strong><br>
            Your objective is to be empathetic to others' emotions. It comes naturlly to step into others shoes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>STRATEGIST</strong><br>
            Your objective is to see the big picture. Have you heard about 'taking the helicopter view'? A special perspective on the world at large, where everything is interconnected.
            </p>
            <p><strong>DELIVERER</strong><br>
            Your objective is to take responsibility. If there is a person who is emotionally bound to follow through on all promises - then it's you. Your strong ethical principles do not let you to simply write missteps off on excuses and rationalizations.
            </p>

            <h3>My Outcome</h3>
            <p> Finally I decided to write one 'current values list', and one ‘aspirational values list’<br>
            These are things I am working on, and intend to develop in the future: </p>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>My ethical decision is when I made a complaint about working conditions at a previous job. I knew that I was going to ruffle some feathers and that conflicts were often not resolved, however I decided to do it anyway, knowing it was important to me to lead my team, stand up for justice and be pragmatic about my approach.
            </p>
            <p>The cultures that influenced my values and identity are;
            <ul>Small town community culture - working in a team, being thrifty, creating something from nothing.
            </ul>
            <ul>Sisterhood - adopted culture - developed from about 18, after leaving home, being independent, trusting my own instincts, building a network of the sisterhood, understanding feminism & my role.
            </ul>
            <p>My strengths are my current values, my limitations are the values I'm working on
            </p>
            <p>In terms of my learning and career development, I already work well as a leader, and I am looking forward to learning how to better work as a team.
            </p>
            <p>The strengths that will help my journey are a generaly positive attitude - use of the catch phrase ‘ahh well!’ in order to ground myself and others when a problem persists. I then re-evaluate the project and try another solution.
            </p>
            <p>I have experienced resistance or tension when taking control of situations that weren't mine to take control of. Depending on my motivation this made me realise I needed to sit back and collaborate, rather than assume I knew the right thing to do.<br>
            It has also been important to recognise the other parties motivation behind their tension. </p>
